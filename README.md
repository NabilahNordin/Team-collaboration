iv. Brief Description of the case study // Nabilah //

- *Title & Requirements*: 
The system is designed for a building with 30 venues suitable for conferences and seminars. It must ensure no scheduling conflicts occur, operating on a first-come, first-served basis, only available venues can be reserved, the booking can also be cancelled and the fee will be displayed as well. The venues are open from 8 am to 11 pm.
